# Chess rules
- Starting with the white player, each player moves one of their pieces on the board.
- During each move, a player can choose to capture a piece of the opposite player using one of their pieces or move one of their pieces to an empty location on the board.
- Moving a piece entails that
    1. the piece must belong to the moving player
    2. the movement of the piece must adhere to the legal moves for the piece
    3. the destination of the move must be empty or contain a piece from the opposing player
    4. the squares between the source and destination must either be empty or the piece must have the ability to "jump over" obstructing pieces
    5. the move must not expose the moving player's king to attack
